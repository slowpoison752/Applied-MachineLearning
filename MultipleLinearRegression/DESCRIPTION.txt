DESCRIPTION

Trying to understand basics of Multiple linear regression with TV sales dataset.

Using Train_test_Split to split data into training and test datasets.

Use OLS Regression result to understand which variable can be discareded based on P-value.

In "ADVERTISING PROBLEM" we try to understand the impact of different advertising mediums on sales.

In "Housing problem" our motive is:

- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.

- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.

- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.
