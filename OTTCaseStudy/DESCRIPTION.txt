DESCRIPTION

Problem Statement: A digital media company (similar to Voot, Hotstar, Netflix, etc.) had launched a show.
 
Initially, the show got a good response, but then witnessed a decline in viewership. The company wants to figure out what went wrong.

Possible causes:

1. Decline in number of people coming to the platform

2. Fewer people visiting video/series

3. Decrease in marketing spends.

4. Competitive shows (including sports, IPL, EPL, etc)

5. Special holiday/ long weekend

6. Twist in story.
