DESCRIPTION

3 datasets:
	1. churn_data
	2. customer_data
	3. internet_data

Merging on: customer id

total columns: 21

Convert categorical variable into dummy/indicator variables.

Converting numeric values in 'object' form to numeric form.

Columns after performing EDA: 32

Uncerstanding correlation in features.

Handling NULL data.

Checking for imbalance in data

Using GLM model and RFE to understand columns that we can use for model creation.

Building a logistic regression model and using it to predict with test data.

Measuring Accuracy for the model.

Checking confusion matrix

Area of improvement:

	1. From the confusion matrix we can conclude that we have 160 false positives.

	2. We can also conclude that we have 321 false negatives.

	3. When we checked for imbalance in data we realized that the data is imbalanced, 
	we need to balance data with undersampling or oversampling.
